# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
Significantly more difficult than the last, but still pretty easy. Figuring out alignment took a while, but everything else was mostly straightforward.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
How to position in CSS properly. I haven't used CSS since high school so I didn't remember much, but it came 


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
I clicked on all of the links to read what was in them, can't remember which ones specifically that I used.


## How could this assignment be improved?
Give a little more in depth instructions on centering that should always work. I couldn't get the vertical and horizontal alignment working at the same time with any of the methods given in the article linked, so I had to look up another way through Google.


## Any other comments?
